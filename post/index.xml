      <description> I was recently told about datapasta, a jewel of a package that provides RStudio addins and functions to freely copy-paste data in and out of a source editor, formatted for immediate use.

      <description>The iSEE package will be presented as a workshop at the Bioconductor 2019 conference in New York City!
What to expect Charlotte Soneson and I will be conducting a workshop that demonstrates the many features and usages of the iSEE package.
With the help of the iSEE team, we have prepared a vignette demonstrating the integration of the package functionality into an example single-cell RNA-sequencing workflow.
The workshop was designed to cater for the needs of users at all levels of familiarity with R and the Bioconductor project.</description>
