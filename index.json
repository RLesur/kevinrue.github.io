For simplicity, type the same name “COVID-19-website”.\nDo not add a README or a license yet, an empty repository will do.\nAdd the GitHub remote to your local clone. The remote name should be \"origin\". The url is shown on your GitHub repository page.\ngit2r::remote_add(name = \u0026quot;origin\u0026quot;, url = \u0026quot;git@github.com:kevinrue/COVID-19-website.git\u0026quot;)  Push your local clone to the GitHub remote While git2r::push() does exist, it can raise issues related to the detection of your git credentials. For simplicity, I prefer to push and pull directly from the terminal. To run the command below, the current working directory must be the root of the RStudio project.\ngit push -u origin master  Clone the source data repository as a git submodule git submodule add git@github.com:CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.git  Write a notebooks for each webpage Fast-forwarding in time, I updated the template index.Rmd and about.Rmd notebooks, added some notebooks, and updated the _site.yml to include those new pages in the built website.\nNote that _site.yml is also useful to exclude certain subdirectories from the built website. In particular, those include the source data folders cloned as a submodule above.\nI also refactored some recurrent code as child notebooks (see the childs/ subdirectory).\n Build the website When you’re ready, click the “Build Webiste” button in the “Build” panel. This is equivalent to running rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8') at the R console. This generates a _site/ subdirectory in your project, that contains all the files for your website.\nTo visualize your website, open the “index.html” file in this subdirectory.\n Deploy the website After inspecting that your website looks as you intend it, you can deploy it on GitHub Pages. This can be done by pushing the files in the _site/ subdirectory. to a gh-pages branch on your GitHub repository.\nInitially, you need to create an empty gh-pages orphan branch as it does not exist. For this, I generally follow instructions in the bookdown book. Briefly:\n# create a branch named gh-pages and clean up everything git checkout --orphan gh-pages git rm -rf . # create a hidden file .nojekyll touch .nojekyll git add .nojekyll git commit -m\u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot; git push origin gh-pages Then, every time you build your website, you need to push the new website to that branch. To automate this process, I wrote a _deploy.sh script, which I run as bash _deplooy.sh. The script is adapted from … and looks like this.\ngit clone -b gh-pages \\ git@github.com:kevinrue/COVID-19-website.git \\ site-output cd site-output git reset --hard HEAD^ git rm -rf * cp -r ../_site/* ./ git add --all * git commit -m \u0026quot;Update the site\u0026quot; git push -f origin gh-pages cd .. rm -rf site-output Note that this script includes two lines that I do not recommend in general. Namely:\ngit reset --hard HEAD^ git push -f origin gh-pages The first line deletes the previous version of the website from the git history, as if it never happened. The second line overrides the GitHub history to erase that commit it from there as well. I only do this here because my website generates many PNG files in each version of the website. If I didn’t delete the previous version each time, the git history would keep track of every version of every PNG file that I ever generated, making the git clone commands increasingly time consuming each time I clone the gh-pages branch to push a new version of the website.\n Thanks for reading!

Next, we will walk participants through the various components of the graphical user interface (GUI). Finally, we will demonstrate how individual instances of iSEE applications can be preconfigured to save time and share insights with others.\nThroughout the workshop, we will showcase key features of the package that make it a great companion for interactive and reproducible analysis for a variety of genomics data modalities:\n A multi-panel layout to simultaneously visualise multiple aspects of the dataset. Point selections using shiny brushes or lasso polygons drawn by consecutive clicks.  Multiple concurrent selections supported in versions ≥ 1.3.8.  Dynamic linking between plot and table panels, allowing users to transmit information across multiple panels via point selection. Dynamic addition, removal, reordering, and resizing of panels. Automatic tracking, storage, and rendering of the exact R code in a shinyAce editor to allow regeneration of all visible plots in a given application instance. Intelligent density-dependent downsampling of data points shown for large data sets. Custom colour scale specification for individual and groups of discrete and continuous variables. Construction of bespoke interactive guided tours using rintrojs. Dynamic detection of discrete and continuous covariates, switching individual plot panels between scatter plots, violin plots, and “square” plots. Ability for users to programmatically define additional custom panels based on any number of user-defined functions performing on-the-fly calculations. Ability to preconfigure app instances, including point selections and state of collapsible panels, to launch individual app instances in any predefined state. Retrieval of gene annotations on the fly by using either user-defined functions or the built-in annotateEntrez or annotateEnsembl functions. Hands-free control of the app using voice recognition by annyang in versions ≥ 1.3.2.
