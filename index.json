Next, we will walk participants through the various components of the graphical user interface (GUI). Finally, we will demonstrate how individual instances of iSEE applications can be preconfigured to save time and share insights with others.\nThroughout the workshop, we will showcase key features of the package that make it a great companion for interactive and reproducible analysis for a variety of genomics data modalities:\n A multi-panel layout to simultaneously visualise multiple aspects of the dataset. Point selections using shiny brushes or lasso polygons drawn by consecutive clicks.  Multiple concurrent selections supported in versions ≥ 1.3.8.  Dynamic linking between plot and table panels, allowing users to transmit information across multiple panels via point selection. Dynamic addition, removal, reordering, and resizing of panels. Automatic tracking, storage, and rendering of the exact R code in a shinyAce editor to allow regeneration of all visible plots in a given application instance. Intelligent density-dependent downsampling of data points shown for large data sets. Custom colour scale specification for individual and groups of discrete and continuous variables. Construction of bespoke interactive guided tours using rintrojs. Dynamic detection of discrete and continuous covariates, switching individual plot panels between scatter plots, violin plots, and “square” plots. Ability for users to programmatically define additional custom panels based on any number of user-defined functions performing on-the-fly calculations. Ability to preconfigure app instances, including point selections and state of collapsible panels, to launch individual app instances in any predefined state. Retrieval of gene annotations on the fly by using either user-defined functions or the built-in annotateEntrez or annotateEnsembl functions. Hands-free control of the app using voice recognition by annyang in versions ≥ 1.3.2.
